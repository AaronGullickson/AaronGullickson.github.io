My research focuses on the issues of inequality and race. I am particularly interested in integrating insights from the study of racial inequality where racial categories are often treated as static and given, with work on racial boundary formation where the dynamic nature of racial categorization and identification is the object of study.

My empirical work has analyzed both contemporary and historical data sources. I have been particularly interested in US history from the end of the Civil War to the crystallization of the one-drop rule in the early 20th  century. I am also currently developing interests in more cross-national comparative work, especially in making comparisons about racialization processes across the Americas.

In addition to my academic interests, I am a bit of a hacker geek and I enjoy playing around with [R](https://www.r-project.org), [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),  [latex](https://www.latex-project.org/), [git](https://git-scm.com/), and other fun and distracting things.
